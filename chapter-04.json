Be sure to plan accordingly and don’t rush students too much. Having said that, accountability to their peers is a central part of making a jigsaw work, so also don’t drag it on too long. There should be some sense of urgency in completing the activities to keep students moving forward. \r</span></span></p><p data-key=\"504\"><span data-key=\"505\"><span data-offset-key=\"505:0\">It really helps streamline the jigsaw process to copy each of the texts in a different color. That way students can find like groups and mixed groups really easily. To prepare for a jigsaw, teachers typically divide the total number of students in the class by the total number of articles and make a couple additional copies of each one. For example, if you have a class of 35 students and 5 articles, you would make 9-10 copies of each. \r</span></span></p><p data-key=\"506\"><span data-key=\"507\"><span data-offset-key=\"507:0\">There are a few strategies you might use for distributing the texts. Again, color-coding makes each of these approaches easier. :\r</span></span></p><ul data-key=\"508\"><li data-key=\"509\"><p data-key=\"510\"><span data-key=\"511\"><span data-offset-key=\"511:0\">Set the piles of articles out on a table and allow students to choose which one they want to read\r</span></span></p></li><li data-key=\"512\"><p data-key=\"513\"><span data-key=\"514\"><span data-offset-key=\"514:0\">If students are sitting in partners or groups, hand out the articles by group\r</span></span></p></li><li data-key=\"515\"><p data-key=\"516\"><span data-key=\"517\"><span data-offset-key=\"517:0\">If you have varied reading levels and want to differentiate, you can distribute articles based on that. The articles represent a range of lengths and levels of difficulty so a teacher can take this approach. \r</span></span></p></li><li data-key=\"518\"><p data-key=\"519\"><span data-key=\"520\"><span data-offset-key=\"520:0\">Be sure not to skip the step where students get to check in with someone else who read the same source as them. This is key to making sure everyone is successful in the jigsaw. Be sure to do this before you hand out the jigsaw note-catcher so they actually talk about the source rather than just copying each other. \r</span></span></p></li></ul><p data-key=\"521\"><span data-key=\"522\"><span data-offset-key=\"522:0\"><span data-slate-zero-width=\"n\">​</span></span></span></p>"
